## Milestone Project 3 - Backend Development

(This is spacing for the main image once project is complete)

- The recipe website is aimed at age 12 onwards to enjoy to cook. The website should bring inspiration and enjoyment through cooking. It should also entice the visitor to prepare something that they did not intend. We want this to be a hub of activity and a place where users will store there recipes and allow other people to view them.
- This is my Milestone Project 3 submission for Code Institutes Diploma in Web Application Development Course. My website uses both relational and non-relational databases, features full CRUD functionality and is built using technologies that I have learnt including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask and PostgreSQL.

## Project Goals

This website is dedicated for people who love food and want to share there love for food. This also has a heavy influence from myself and my girlfriend as this is a dream we've always wanted, a website where we can express our creativity with food for everyone to enjoy. There will be a lot of recipes from ourselves but also recipes from other people who have uploaded them. There are also articles about food which people can read and create themselves.

There is an account page which will be the hub for the return user so they can store all their recipes and have somewhere to go back to.

## Design

### Overview

We want the design to homely but modern with very sleek kitchen feel. This is a place for people who can cook and if they are on the site for long we want it to be aesthetically pleasing. The name of the website is "Plant Plates", we are vegan and this represents that. We've look at multiple popular websites to understand the design layout and how they use the space appropriately e.g. not too many images, easy to read writing.

### Colour

### Typography

The fonts which I have picked are Lora and Playfair Display. I will use Lora for main headings and buttons where as I'll use Playfair Display for paragraphing and longer pieces of text. Both of these fonts are different, easy to read and also quite elegant.

### Imagery

Since it is a recipe website, I'm going to keep most of the images centered around the food. Most images will be posted by the users through the creation of recipes. Articles can also have images which will be posted through the same way as recipes.

### Wireframes
